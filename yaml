## 🧠 How Scoring Works

### 1. **Rule-Based**
- Matches rubric keywords in the transcript.
- Keyword score = fraction of keywords matched.

### 2. **Semantic Similarity (TF-IDF)**
- Computes similarity between rubric descriptions and transcript.

### 3. **Word-Count Score**
- Penalty if transcript is below minimum or above maximum.

### 4. **Weighted Combination**
Each criterion score =  
Then scaled by rubric weight → contributes to final score.

# Deployment Guide

## 1. Local Deployment
You can run the tool on any system with Python 3.8+.

Steps:
1. Install dependencies
2. Place rubric + transcript inside /data
3. Run evaluation_script.py
4. Output will appear in /output

---

## 2. Remote Deployment (Optional)
You can deploy on:
- Google Colab
- PythonAnywhere Free Tier
- Render free tier
- GitHub Codespaces
- Railway.app (free)

Since this is not a production system, simple execution is enough.

---

## 3. Using GitHub Codespaces
1. Open repo in GitHub
2. Click "Code" → "Open in Codespaces"
3. Install requirements
4. Run the script

---

## 4. Video Recording Guide
Record your screen showing:
- Running the notebook OR running the Python script
- Showing the final score + breakdown

Use:
- OBS Studio
- Windows Screen Recorder (Win + G)
- Loom (free)
